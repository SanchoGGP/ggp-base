A snake-like game of 2 players, based on the light-cycle game in the movie Tron (1982). Two players move around a 10x10 board surrounded by walls. Visited cells cannot be visited again by either player. At each step both sides can move 1 square up/down/left/right.  If at least one player crashes into the wall, or previously visited cells, or both sides collide, the game ends. The survivor gets 100 points. The dead gets 0 points. If both sides are dead at the same time, they get 50 points each.
